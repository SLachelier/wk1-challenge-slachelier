# Code Refactor Week 1 Challenge
## Refactored by Shauna Lachelier

### Description
This codebase was refactored to provide organized semantic structure better accessibility to users. I wanted to gain experience in making a website accessible for everyone and optimizing SEO. Due to these refactored changes, the website will be much easier to read with screen readers, and have less redundant code. From making these adjustments, I've learned more about identifying which selectors to consolidate, as well as double checking my code for any errors. After looking over the code, I thought I had refactored everything. However, I found more to be adjusted. My project will stand out from the rest because of how I organized my CSS selectors into their commented sections that follow the flow of the website, with the cascading algorithm kept in mind.
